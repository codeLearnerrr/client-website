This website is from a client, and i was allowed to post it here. Bootstrap was used, along with other libraries such as Jquery and Google Maps API.And it is hosted in Amazon Web Services S3, along with CloudFront (for fast loading and cache) and Lambda@Edge (for the Content Security Policy headers)
